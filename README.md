 Predicting the “CustomerValue” in a retail store as High/
Medium/Low
Problem Statement:
To predict the Customer value for a retail store based on different quantitative
and qualitative features provided.
The customer value is a profitability metric in terms of a value placed by the company on each
customer and can be conceived in two dimensions: the customer`s present Value and potential
future Value.
A major retail store wants to evaluate customer lvalue in terms of high/medium/low based on each
customer’s demographics and purchase information/ sales transactions, to take optimal
marketing/promotional decisions and implement appropriate action plans .
You are expected to create an analytical and modelling framework to predict customer value of each
customer as High/Medium/Low based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the
dataset.
Data:
1. Train.csv & Test.csv (CustomerId and Target 
attribute:”CustomerValue”, but Test.csv doesn’t have Target attribute as
it is to be predicted)
2. Train_Transactions.csv & Test_Transactions.csv
3. Train_Demographics.csv & Test_Demographics.csv
Objective:
You are expected to create an analytical and modeling framework to
predict the CustomerValue for each CustomerId as either of three classes
( “High”, “Medium” & “Low”) based on the quantitative and
qualitative features provided in the data.
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy
